# Configuration

> [!TIP]
> You can see all of the configurable options by [looking at the default config.json](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy/blob/main/app/config.json), and the upload service's in [its own config.json](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy/blob/main/upload-app/config.json). A description of each option is on the pages in this section.

Connection settings (the Immich URL, public URL, port and config file location) are
[environment variables](/config/environment-variables). Everything else is JSON config under `ipp.*`, grouped into:

- [General options](/config/ipp-options) - downloads, zoom quality, slug links, the upload link, response headers.
- [Gallery](/config/gallery) - how the gallery page is rendered.
- [Lightbox](/config/lightbox) - the PhotoSwipe image viewer.
- [Metadata](/config/metadata) - description / EXIF / location reveal controls.
- [Download metadata](/config/download-metadata) - strip camera and location data from downloaded JPEGs and write your creator and copyright information.
- [Error responses](/config/error-responses) - customise what invalid requests return.
- [Upload service](/config/upload-service) - the optional container that lets visitors send photos back.
- [Renamed config keys](/config/upgrading) - old keys and their current names.

## How to provide a config override

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to include the keys you're changing. Anything you omit keeps its default, and the defaults are always the most private option. Nothing in the [metadata](/config/metadata) groups is shown until you set its flag to `true`.

There are two ways to supply custom config. If both are present, `CONFIG` wins and the file is not read.

### Mount a file

Recommended for anything non-trivial. Make a copy of [config.json](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-public-proxy/blob/main/app/config.json) next to your `docker-compose.yml`, edit it, then add a volume:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json
```

Restart the container and your custom configuration becomes active.

### Inline via env var

For one-off or single-key overrides, pass the configuration inline from your `docker-compose.yml` using the `CONFIG` environment variable:

```yaml
  environment:
    PUBLIC_BASE_URL: https://your-proxy-url.com
    IMMICH_URL: http://your-internal-immich-server:2283
    CONFIG: |
      {
        "ipp": {
          "showHomePage": false
        }
      }
```
