/**
 * Stream the given assets back as a zip file.
 *
 * Immich's own download service (server/src/services/download.service.ts)
 * zips files straight off local disk. We're a proxy fetching over HTTP, so
 * each asset is fetched from Immich and its body piped directly into the
 * archive - nothing is staged to disk or held in memory, so a zip of any
 * size needs only a few stream buffers #289.
 *
 * Assets are fetched strictly one at a time. Archiver writes entries
 * serially anyway, and an unread response body would hold an idle
 * connection open on Immich for as long as the current entry takes to reach
 * the visitor - long enough for a reverse proxy to close it. The cost is
 * Immich's per-request overhead between entries, which is negligible next
 * to the visitor's link speed.
 *
 * Failure handling:
 *   - Headers fail (after retries) before anything has been sent: an
 *     ordinary 404, so the visitor sees an error page rather than an empty
 *     download. The real reason goes to the server log.
 *   - Anything fails once the zip is on the wire: the socket is destroyed
 *     and the visitor gets a visibly broken download. That's deliberate; the
 *     alternative is a zip quietly missing files.
 *   - Visitor disconnects: the upstream fetch is aborted so Immich stops
 *     streaming, and the archive is torn down so it releases the in-flight
 *     entry #284.
 *
 * There is no body-level idle timeout: with the visitor as the sink, a slow
 * or paused client stalls the flow just like a stalled upstream would, so a
 * timer on the body can't tell them apart. The header timeout still bounds
 * how long Immich may take to start answering.
 *
 * Zip entries use STORE (no compression), since photos and videos are
 * already compressed.
